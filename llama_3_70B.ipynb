If she never played board games with him (hypothesis 1), it wouldn't explain why she got bored of the game. On the other hand, hypothesis 2, that she decided to play a board game with the boy, fits well with the observation that she got bored of the game, suggesting that the game was not engaging enough for her.\n"," * Stats:  31.58% correct, (627 total, 198 correct, 23 unknown)\n","2\n","The answer is hypothesis 2.\n","\n","Explanation: Tanya wanted to mount her degrees on the wall, but her internet start-up manager stopped her. This suggests that the manager had authority over the workspace and was concerned about the appearance of the office. Hypothesis 2, that the boss didn't allow clutter on the walls, is a plausible explanation for why the manager stopped Tanya. It implies that the manager was enforcing a rule or policy about the office decor. Hypothesis 1, that Tanya decided to put nails in the wall, doesn't necessarily explain why the manager stopped her, and it's unclear why putting nails in the wall would be a problem.\n"," * Stats:  31.53% correct, (628 total, 198 correct, 23 unknown)\n","2\n","The answer is hypothesis 2.\n","\n","Explanation:\n","Joey, a second grader, likes to color in coloring books, and he felt proud of himself. This suggests that he accomplished something notable in his coloring activity. Hypothesis 2, that Joey colored in 20 books, implies that he achieved a significant milestone, which would make him feel proud of himself. On the other hand, hypothesis 1, that Joey mis-colored the picture, would likely make him feel disappointed or frustrated, not proud.\n"," * Stats:  31.48% correct, (629 total, 198 correct, 23 unknown)\n","1\n","The answer is hypothesis 1.\n","\n","Explanation: Jason compromised and ate his cereal dry, suggesting that something unexpected happened that prevented him from having his cereal with milk as usual. Hypothesis 1, that the milk was sour, provides a plausible explanation for why Jason would compromise and eat his cereal dry. It implies that he started to pour the milk, but then noticed the bad smell and decided not to use it. Hypothesis 2, that Jason was out of milk, is possible but less likely, as it doesn't explain why Jason would specifically \"compromise\" and eat his cereal dry.\n"," * Stats:  31.43% correct, (630 total, 198 correct, 23 unknown)\n","2\n","The most plausible explanation is Hypothesis 2: Marcia got an awful haircut.\n","\n","The observation that Marcia went to a new hairdresser and then immediately went to her old hairdresser to get it fixed suggests that she was not satisfied with the result of the new hairdresser's work. This implies that she got a bad haircut, which led her to seek out her old hairdresser to fix it.

Although hypothesis 1, that Jacob made a small scale wind turbine farm, is a possible project, it's not a direct explanation for his success.

However, the fact that it was a surprise gift from his grandmother for his birthday implies that he eventually opened the package and discovered the sender. Hypothesis 2, that Rick opened and saw who the box was from, fits this scenario, whereas Hypothesis 1, that Rick was not sure what the individual was, doesn't explain how he came to know it was a gift from his grandmother.\n"," * Stats:  31.44% correct, (633 total, 199 correct, 23 unknown)\n","2\n","John's nervousness about his flight suggests he had a fear of flying or anxiety related to it.

This suggests that Amy met Cinderella in a setting where photos were being taken, likely a theme park or a character meet-and-greet event. Hypothesis 2, that Amy's family took her to Florida, is a plausible explanation since Florida is home to several theme parks, including Walt Disney World, where Cinderella is a popular character. Hypothesis 1, that Amy's mom found a dress-up Cinderella or Amy to see, is less likely since it doesn't explain the context of the family taking pictures with Cinderella.\n"," * Stats:  31.76% correct, (636 total, 202 correct, 23 unknown)\n","2\n","Gina was excited for prom, and on prom night, she was happy.

Hypothesis 1, that Sally went to get a wig, doesn't fit with the context of needing a haircut and being disappointed with the result.\n"," * Stats:  31.22% correct, (1515 total, 473 correct, 56 unknown)\n","1\n","The correct answer is Hypothesis 1: He wanted me to rely on teamwork instead.\n","\n","The coach's advice to \"not trust in my talents\" suggests that the coach wanted the player to focus on other aspects of their game, rather than relying solely on their natural abilities. The fact that the player placed first in the tournament thanks to the coach's advice implies that the coach's advice was effective in helping the player improve their game. Hypothesis 1, that the coach wanted the player to rely on teamwork instead, is a plausible explanation for the coach's advice and the player's success. Hypothesis 2, that the player decided not to continue practicing because they didn't think they needed to, is not supported by the fact that the player placed first in the tournament, and is therefore less plausible.\n"," * Stats:  31.2% correct, (1516 total, 473 correct, 56 unknown)\n","2\n","The answer is hypothesis 1.\n","\n","Explanation: Carlos was disgusted by oysters, implying a strong aversion. His decision to never be afraid of trying new food again suggests a significant event occurred that changed his perspective. Hypothesis 1, that Carlos tried an oyster on a dare and got sick, explains why he would make a conscious decision to overcome his fear of trying new foods. Hypothesis 2, that Carlos loved oysters, doesn't fit with his initial disgust and doesn't explain the change in his behavior.\n"," * Stats:  31.25% correct, (1517 total, 474 correct, 56 unknown)\n","2\n","The most plausible explanation is Hypothesis 2: Jay thought he accidentally threw away his keys.\n","\n","Jay digging in the trash for nothing suggests that he was searching for something he thought he might have thrown away. Hypothesis 2 provides a plausible reason for this behavior, namely that Jay thought he might have accidentally thrown away his keys. This explanation fits better than Hypothesis 1, which doesn't provide a strong enough reason for Jay to dig through the trash.\n"," * Stats:  31.23% correct, (1518 total, 474 correct, 56 unknown)\n","2\n","The answer is hypothesis 2.\n","\n","Gina skinned her knee while chasing Dave, which suggests that the chase took place in a physical environment where falls can occur, such as a concrete playground. Hypothesis 2 provides a clear explanation for Gina's injury, whereas hypothesis 1 only mentions Gina screaming at Dave, which doesn't necessarily lead to her skinned knee.\n"," * Stats:  31.2% correct, (1519 total, 474 correct, 56 unknown)\n","The answer is not either of the given hypotheses.\n","\n","The correct explanation is that Charles feels alone because he believes in a conspiracy theory (9/11 being an inside job) that is not widely accepted, and this belief isolates him from others who may not share his views.

The correct explanation is that Joy's middle-aged pal was getting ready for the concert, and the toupee and dentures were part of his preparation to look his best for the event. The presence of these items suggests that he was concerned about his appearance, which is a common concern for people attending social events like concerts.\n","The answer is neither of the above hypotheses.

The fact that he \"bolted off of first base and slid into second\" and was safe implies that he was successful in his attempt. This fits with hypothesis 1, that he knew he was fast enough to make it to second base safely. Hypothesis 2, that he knew it was a bad play, doesn't align with the fact that he was successful and safe at second base.\n"," * Stats:  31.14% correct, (1522 total, 474 correct, 58 unknown)\n","1\n","The most plausible explanation is Hypothesis 1: Maria still thought he was cute.\n","\n","The observation that Jerome was an awkward child of the 70s suggests that he may not have been the most popular or confident kid. However, the fact that he got married, had kids, and was happy implies that he found someone who loved and accepted him for who he was. Hypothesis 1, that Maria still thought he was cute, provides a plausible explanation for why Jerome was able to find happiness in his personal life. It suggests that Maria saw beyond Jerome's awkwardness and appreciated his inner qualities. Hypothesis 2, that Jerome met a lovely girl named Emma, is not supported by the observations, as there is no mention of Emma in the original statements.\n"," * Stats:  31.12% correct, (1523 total, 474 correct, 58 unknown)\n","1\n","The answer is hypothesis 1.\n","\n","Explanation: Sam and his wife hated doing chores, which suggests they tend to avoid or put off doing them. When he got back, he had clogged gutters and an angry wife, implying that he had neglected to do the chores before leaving, leading to his wife's anger. Hypothesis 1, that Sam forgot to unclog the gutters before going on vacation, fits with this scenario. Hypothesis 2, that Sam sucked it up and cleaned the gutters, doesn't explain why he had clogged gutters and an angry wife when he got back.\n"," * Stats:  31.1% correct, (1524 total, 474 correct, 58 unknown)\n","2\n","The answer is hypothesis 2.\n","\n","Miriam initially worried that she was bad at math, but then changed her mind and thought maybe she wasn't bad at math after all. This suggests that something happened to make her reevaluate her abilities. Hypothesis 2, that she did very well on her exam, provides a clear explanation for this change in thinking. It implies that Miriam's good performance on the exam boosted her confidence and made her realize she might not be bad at math after all. Hypothesis 1, on the other hand, suggests that Miriam did poorly on her first math test, which would likely reinforce her initial worries, not change her mind.\n"," * Stats:  31.08% correct, (1525 total, 474 correct, 58 unknown)\n","1\n","The answer is Hypothesis 2: Sara and her friend finally agreed on a plan.\n","\n","Explanation:\n","The disagreement between Blanca and her best friend suggests a conflict or issue that needed to be resolved. The fact that they had a fun girl's night in afterwards implies that they were able to put their disagreement aside and come to an agreement. Hypothesis 2, that Sara and her friend finally agreed on a plan, explains how they were able to move past their disagreement and have a fun night together. Hypothesis 1, that Blanca decided to forget about it and spend time with her other friends, doesn't fully explain how the disagreement was resolved, and it's unclear why she would spend time with other friends instead of resolving the issue with her best friend.\n"," * Stats:  31.13% correct, (1526 total, 475 correct, 58 unknown)\n","1\n","The correct answer is neither of the provided hypotheses.

The sudden introduction of a game jamming and Dale losing all his money implies that he engaged in some activity that involved a game and money. Hypothesis 2, that Dale found an arcade and played a game, fits better with the context. It's likely that Dale played a game at the arcade and lost all his money when the game jammed. Hypothesis 1, that Dale went to the restaurant, doesn't explain the game jamming and losing money.\n"," * Stats:  31.15% correct, (1528 total, 476 correct, 58 unknown)\n","2\n","I think the most plausible explanation is Hypothesis 1: I opened the flue and a bunch of ash fell out.\n","\n","The observation \"I realized I should be more careful when cleaning the chimney\" suggests that something unexpected or unpleasant happened while cleaning the chimney, leading to a realization about the need for more caution. Hypothesis 1 provides a plausible explanation for this realization, as opening the flue and having a bunch of ash fall out could be a messy and potentially hazardous experience, prompting the realization about being more careful. Hypothesis 2, finding a bird's nest and knocking it down, might be a minor inconvenience, but it doesn't quite fit with the level of caution implied by the observation.\n"," * Stats:  31.2% correct, (1529 total, 477 correct, 58 unknown)\n","1\n","The most plausible explanation is Hypothesis 1: I decided to call my aunt.\n","\n","The observation \"I was home alone one evening\" suggests that the speaker was by themselves at home, and then they had a conversation with someone that lasted for an hour. The fact that they talked for an hour implies a voice conversation, which is more likely to occur over a phone call than a text conversation. Additionally, the use of \"when she answered\" suggests that the speaker was waiting for the person to pick up the phone, which is consistent with making a phone call.\n"," * Stats:  31.24% correct, (1530 total, 478 correct, 58 unknown)\n","2\n","The answer is hypothesis 2.\n","\n","Explanation: Abby got a new doll for her birthday, and the description of her jumping up and looking down at Susie, who just rolled out of bed, suggests a close and intimate interaction between Abby and Susie. This fits with hypothesis 2, that Abby called the doll Susie and cuddled with it in bed. Hypothesis 1, that the doll started snoring in the night, is an unlikely explanation and doesn't make sense in the context of the observations.\n"," * Stats:  31.22% correct, (1531 total, 478 correct, 58 unknown)\n","1\n","The answer is hypothesis 1.\n","\n","Explanation:\n","Jim got ready for his first date, suggesting he was excited and invested in the date. However, since then, the girl has ignored all of Jim's text messages, implying that the date did not go well. Hypothesis 1, that Jim's date wasn't attracted to him, explains why she would ignore his messages.
